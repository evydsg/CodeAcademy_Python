# Lovely Loveseats Receipt System

## Overview
Hey there! Welcome to the Lovely Loveseats Receipt System project! I'm thrilled to share my journey with you as I pursue the dream of small-business ownership by opening a furniture store called Lovely Loveseats for Neat Suites on Fleet Street. With my newfound knowledge of Python programming, I'm excited to build a system that speeds up the process of creating receipts for my customers.

In this project, I'll be storing the names and prices of my furniture store's catalog in variables. Then, I'll process the total price and item list of my customers, printing them to the output terminal.

## Tasks
Throughout this project, I'll be completing the following tasks:

### Adding In The Catalog
1. Creating variables for the Lovely Loveseat description and price.
2. Setting up variables for the Stylish Settee description and price.
3. Defining variables for the Luxurious Lamp description and price.
4. Setting the sales tax variable.

### Our First Customer
5. Setting up variables for my first customer's total and itemization.
6. Adding the Lovely Loveseat to the customer's purchase.
7. Updating the itemization with the Lovely Loveseat description.
8. Adding the Luxurious Lamp to the customer's purchase.
9. Updating the itemization with the Luxurious Lamp description.
10. Calculating sales tax for the customer's total cost.
11. Printing the customer's itemization.
12. Printing the customer's total cost.

## Project Completion
Yay! Congratulations on completing the Lovely Loveseats Receipt System project! With this system in place, I'm ready to efficiently generate receipts for my customers and provide excellent service at Lovely Loveseats.

# Magic 8-Ball Project

## Introduction

Welcome to my Magic 8-Ball project! The Magic 8-Ball is a timeless toy that provides amusing answers to yes or no questions. In this Python project, `magic8.py`, I'll be bringing the Magic 8-Ball to life using programming, allowing users to ask questions and receive mysterious responses.

## Project Details

This project involves creating a Python program that mimics the functionality of a Magic 8-Ball. Users can ask yes or no questions, and the program will generate random responses from a predefined set of answers. Throughout the project, I'll set up variables, generate random numbers, implement control flow, and display the results to the user.

## Tasks

In this project, I'll complete the following tasks:

1. **Setting up**: Declare variables to store the name of the person asking the question, the question itself, and the Magic 8-Ball's answer.

2. **Generating a random number**: Utilize the `random.randint()` function to generate a random number between 1 and 9.

3. **Control Flow**: Use conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`) to assign different answers based on the randomly generated number.

4. **Displaying the result**: Print the user's question, along with the Magic 8-Ball's answer, to the console in a specified format.

## Implementation

To run the Magic 8-Ball program, simply execute the `magic8.py` file in your Python environment. Follow the prompts to ask a yes or no question and receive an enigmatic response from the Magic 8-Ball.

## Let's Get Started!

Join me on this journey into the realm of possibilities with the Magic 8-Ball. Ask your burning questions and unlock the secrets that lie within!

**Note**: Run the program multiple times to experience different answers each time.

# My Sal's Shipping Project

## Introduction

Welcome to my Sal's Shipping program! I'm excited to present this Python project, `shipping.py`, where I'll be building a program to determine the cheapest method of shipping a package based on its weight. 

Sal's Shippers is committed to offering the best and most affordable shipping options for its customers. With this project, I aim to implement a solution that accurately calculates shipping costs and helps customers make informed decisions.

## Project Details

This project involves creating a Python program that prompts the user for the weight of their package and calculates the shipping cost using Sal's Shippers' pricing structure. By comparing the costs of ground shipping, ground shipping premium, and drone shipping, the program will identify the most cost-effective option for the customer.

## Tasks

Throughout this project, I will complete the following tasks:

1. Define a weight variable to represent the weight of the package.
2. Calculate the cost of ground shipping based on the weight using an if/elif/else statement.
3. Print the cost of ground shipping.
4. Define the cost of premium ground shipping.
5. Print the cost of premium ground shipping.
6. Calculate the cost of drone shipping based on the weight using an if/elif/else statement.
7. Print the cost of drone shipping.
8. Test the program with different package weights to verify the calculations.
9. Check off all tasks before proceeding.

## Implementation

To utilize the program, simply execute the `shipping.py` file in your Python environment. Follow the prompts to enter the weight of your package, and the program will determine the cheapest shipping method and display the total cost.

Feel free to experiment with different package weights to see how the shipping costs vary.

## Let's Get Started!

Join me in exploring the world of shipping costs with Sal's Shippers. Let's find the most affordable shipping option for your package!

# Gradebook Project
