# My Python Programming Lesson Review

## Overview
In this lesson, I accomplished various tasks to solidify my understanding of Python programming fundamentals. Here's a summary of what I achieved:

- **Printing Messages**: I instructed my computer to print messages to the console.
- **Variable Manipulation**: I stored messages as variables and learned how to update them based on different parts of my program.
- **Mathematical Calculations**: I performed mathematical calculations using Python's arithmetic operators.
- **Exploring Python Expressions**: I delved into the mathematical expressions that Python offers for performing complex calculations.
- **Error Handling**: I encountered errors and learned how to handle them effectively.
  
## Resources
To further enhance my Python programming skills and have additional references at my disposal, I can explore the following resources:

- [Codecademy Docs: Python](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3/modules/learn-python3-introduction)
- [Codecademy Workspaces: Python](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3/modules/learn-python3-control-flow/cheatsheet)
  
I'll make sure to bookmark these links for quick access whenever I need guidance or reference materials.

## Task Instructions
To practice and reinforce the concepts covered in this lesson, I can proceed with the following tasks:

### Checkpoint 1
1. Create the following variables:
   - `my_age`
   - `half_my_age`
   - `greeting`
   - `name`
   - `greeting_with_name`
   
   Assign appropriate values to each variable using my knowledge of division and concatenation.

# Lovely Loveseats Receipt System

## Overview
Hey there! Welcome to the Lovely Loveseats Receipt System project! I'm thrilled to share my journey with you as I pursue the dream of small-business ownership by opening a furniture store called Lovely Loveseats for Neat Suites on Fleet Street. With my newfound knowledge of Python programming, I'm excited to build a system that speeds up the process of creating receipts for my customers.

In this project, I'll be storing the names and prices of my furniture store's catalog in variables. Then, I'll process the total price and item list of my customers, printing them to the output terminal.

## Tasks
Throughout this project, I'll be completing the following tasks:

### Adding In The Catalog
1. Creating variables for the Lovely Loveseat description and price.
2. Setting up variables for the Stylish Settee description and price.
3. Defining variables for the Luxurious Lamp description and price.
4. Setting the sales tax variable.

### Our First Customer
5. Setting up variables for my first customer's total and itemization.
6. Adding the Lovely Loveseat to the customer's purchase.
7. Updating the itemization with the Lovely Loveseat description.
8. Adding the Luxurious Lamp to the customer's purchase.
9. Updating the itemization with the Luxurious Lamp description.
10. Calculating sales tax for the customer's total cost.
11. Printing the customer's itemization.
12. Printing the customer's total cost.

## Project Completion
Yay! Congratulations on completing the Lovely Loveseats Receipt System project! With this system in place, I'm ready to efficiently generate receipts for my customers and provide excellent service at Lovely Loveseats.

# Magic 8-Ball Project

## Introduction

Welcome to my Magic 8-Ball project! The Magic 8-Ball is a timeless toy that provides amusing answers to yes or no questions. In this Python project, `magic8.py`, I'll be bringing the Magic 8-Ball to life using programming, allowing users to ask questions and receive mysterious responses.

## Project Details

This project involves creating a Python program that mimics the functionality of a Magic 8-Ball. Users can ask yes or no questions, and the program will generate random responses from a predefined set of answers. Throughout the project, I'll set up variables, generate random numbers, implement control flow, and display the results to the user.

## Tasks

In this project, I'll complete the following tasks:

1. **Setting up**: Declare variables to store the name of the person asking the question, the question itself, and the Magic 8-Ball's answer.

2. **Generating a random number**: Utilize the `random.randint()` function to generate a random number between 1 and 9.

3. **Control Flow**: Use conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`) to assign different answers based on the randomly generated number.

4. **Displaying the result**: Print the user's question, along with the Magic 8-Ball's answer, to the console in a specified format.

## Implementation

To run the Magic 8-Ball program, simply execute the `magic8.py` file in your Python environment. Follow the prompts to ask a yes or no question and receive an enigmatic response from the Magic 8-Ball.

## Let's Get Started!

Join me on this journey into the realm of possibilities with the Magic 8-Ball. Ask your burning questions and unlock the secrets that lie within!

**Note**: Run the program multiple times to experience different answers each time.
