# My Python Programming Lesson Review

## Overview
In this lesson, I accomplished various tasks to solidify my understanding of Python programming fundamentals. Here's a summary of what I achieved:

- **Printing Messages**: I instructed my computer to print messages to the console.
- **Variable Manipulation**: I stored messages as variables and learned how to update them based on different parts of my program.
- **Mathematical Calculations**: I performed mathematical calculations using Python's arithmetic operators.
- **Exploring Python Expressions**: I delved into the mathematical expressions that Python offers for performing complex calculations.
- **Error Handling**: I encountered errors and learned how to handle them effectively.

# Lovely Loveseats Receipt System

## Overview
Hey there! Welcome to the Lovely Loveseats Receipt System project! I'm thrilled to share my journey with you as I pursue the dream of small-business ownership by opening a furniture store called Lovely Loveseats for Neat Suites on Fleet Street. With my newfound knowledge of Python programming, I'm excited to build a system that speeds up the process of creating receipts for my customers.

In this project, I'll be storing the names and prices of my furniture store's catalog in variables. Then, I'll process the total price and item list of my customers, printing them to the output terminal.

## Tasks
Throughout this project, I'll be completing the following tasks:

### Adding In The Catalog
1. Creating variables for the Lovely Loveseat description and price.
2. Setting up variables for the Stylish Settee description and price.
3. Defining variables for the Luxurious Lamp description and price.
4. Setting the sales tax variable.

### Our First Customer
5. Setting up variables for my first customer's total and itemization.
6. Adding the Lovely Loveseat to the customer's purchase.
7. Updating the itemization with the Lovely Loveseat description.
8. Adding the Luxurious Lamp to the customer's purchase.
9. Updating the itemization with the Luxurious Lamp description.
10. Calculating sales tax for the customer's total cost.
11. Printing the customer's itemization.
12. Printing the customer's total cost.

## Project Completion
Yay! Congratulations on completing the Lovely Loveseats Receipt System project! With this system in place, I'm ready to efficiently generate receipts for my customers and provide excellent service at Lovely Loveseats.
