# My Python Programming Lesson Review

## Overview
In this lesson, I accomplished various tasks to solidify my understanding of Python programming fundamentals. Here's a summary of what I achieved:

- **Printing Messages**: I instructed my computer to print messages to the console.
- **Variable Manipulation**: I stored messages as variables and learned how to update them based on different parts of my program.
- **Mathematical Calculations**: I performed mathematical calculations using Python's arithmetic operators.
- **Exploring Python Expressions**: I delved into the mathematical expressions that Python offers for performing complex calculations.
- **Error Handling**: I encountered errors and learned how to handle them effectively.

## Task Instructions
To practice and reinforce the concepts covered in this lesson, I can proceed with the following tasks:

### Checkpoint 1
1. Create the following variables:
   - `my_age`
   - `half_my_age`
   - `greeting`
   - `name`
   - `greeting_with_name`
   
   Assign appropriate values to each variable using my knowledge of division and concatenation.
